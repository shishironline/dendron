[[what is gene imprinting]]



[[The evolutionary significance of gene imprinting]]



Do you want me to delve deeper into a specific aspect of gene imprinting, such as:

*   The role of specific syndromes (Prader-Willi, Angelman)?
*   The mechanisms of imprint erasure and re-establishment?
*   The evolutionary significance of gene imprinting?
